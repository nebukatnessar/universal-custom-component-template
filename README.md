This repository is not an official Thinkwise software product, it is provided by me, Sebastiaan Meijerink an employee, as an example.
This example intends to get you started with a custom component with a vite / react stack.
You are free to use it as a starting point in any commercial use you see fit.
But Thinkwise will not address any issues with the example given.
